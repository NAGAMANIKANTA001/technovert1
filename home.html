                    Imagine an internaional gateway where goods and merchendise flow across borders. Where
                    countries lower taxes, reduce red tape, and eliminate road blocks. Where companies
                    import goods and merchendise directly into a Free Trade Zone - and then ship products
                    out duty free.
